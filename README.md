**Project Description:**
This project leverages machine learning techniques, specifically K-means clustering, to perform customer segmentation of mall shoppers. By analyzing customers' spending scores and annual income, we aim to uncover distinct customer groups. This segmentation provides valuable insights for targeted marketing strategies, optimizing customer engagement, and enhancing business profitability. Explore the code and findings to better understand your mall's customer demographics and potential growth opportunities.
